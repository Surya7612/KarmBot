# KarmBot

KarmBot is an automated job application bot designed to streamline the process of applying for jobs. It integrates web scraping, AI-generated cover letters, and an alert system to notify the user of applications requiring manual review. KarmBot aims to reduce the repetitive nature of job hunting, saving you valuable time and effort.

## Features

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- **Web Scraping for Job Listings**: Scrape job postings from target websites and extract relevant job details (e.g., title, company, application link).
- **Automated Application Submission**: Autofill application forms with basic details (name, email, resume) to apply to jobs automatically.
- **AI-Generated Cover Letters**: Use GPT integration to generate personalized cover letters for each job application.
- **Notification System**: Send alerts for applications that require manual review using Twilio or email notifications.

### Future Enhancements
- **Multiple Job Sites Integration**: Extend web scraping functionality to support multiple job boards (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed).
- **Advanced Filtering**: Introduce job filters based on experience, salary, location, and other criteria.
- **Resume and Cover Letter Customization**: Enable dynamic resume and cover letter selection based on the job role and description.
- **Application Tracking**: Store application history and status in a local database (SQLite) for easy tracking.
- **User Interface**: Build a GUI using Flask or React to interact with KarmBot easily.
- **Parallel Processing**: Use multithreading to scrape multiple job boards and submit applications simultaneously.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Surya7612/KarmBot.git
    cd KarmBot
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv karm
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      karm\\Scripts\\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source karm/bin/activate
      ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Set Up Configuration**:
   - In the `config/` folder, update `config.py` with your necessary API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Twilio) and settings.

## Usage

- **Run KarmBot**:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
- **Modules**:
  - `job_scraper.py`: Scrapes job listings from target websites.
  - `apply_bot.py`: Automates the application process using the scraped data.
  - `cover_letter.py`: Generates AI-based cover letters using GPT integration.
  - `notifier.py`: Sends notifications for manual review of applications.
